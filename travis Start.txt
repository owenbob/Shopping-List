First time here? Let's get you started!

Activate GitHub Repositories

Once you're signed in, and we've initially synchronized your repositories from GitHub, go to your profile page for open source or for your private projects.

You'll see all the organizations you're a member of and all the repositories you have access to. The ones you have administrative access to are the ones you can enable the service hook for.

Flip the switch to on for all repositories you'd like to enable.

Add .travis.yml file to your repository

In order for Travis CI to build your project, you need to tell the systems a little bit about it. You'll need to add a file named .travis.yml to the root of your repository.

If .travis.yml is not in the repository, is misspelled or is not valid YAML, Travis CI will ignore it.

Here you can find some of our basic language examples.

Trigger your first build with a git push

Once the GitHub hook is set up, push your commit that adds .travis.yml to your repository. That should add a build into one of the queues on Travis CI and your build will start as soon as one worker for your language is available.

To start a build, perform one of the following:

Commit and push something to your repository
Go to your repository's settings page, click on "Webhooks & Services" on the left menu, choose "Travis CI" in the "Services", and use the "Test service" button.
NOTE: You cannot trigger your first build using Test Hook button. It has to be triggered by a push to your repository.

That's pretty much it!
